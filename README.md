A simple social network where people can publish just one message a day with 140 characters and no links.

This would be my favorite social network. Get information in 140 characters and not just a link which leads to a whole article.

**This was a 1 day project. Controllers and that stuff aren't tested. It was just a project for me to see how I would build a social news site today.**

Feel free to use it and make it big. Just consider to hire me if you do so ;)
